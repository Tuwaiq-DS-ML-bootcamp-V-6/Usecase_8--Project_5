# Goodreads Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a book recommendation system using data scraped from Goodreads. The aim is to help users discover new books based on their preferences and reading history.

## Dataset

### Source
The dataset was scraped from Goodreads, a popular website for book lovers to rate and review books. 

### Contents
The dataset contains information about various books, including their titles, authors, genres, and ratings. The structure of the dataset is as follows:

- `Book_Title`: The title of the book.
- `Author`: The author of the book.
- `Genres`: A list of genres associated with the book.
- `Rating`: The average rating of the book on Goodreads.
