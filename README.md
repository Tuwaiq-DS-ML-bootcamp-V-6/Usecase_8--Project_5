- **Datasets** :The cleaned Dataset is available on Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tariqwashtan/riyadh-restaurants-dataset)

**Project Structure**

- **Web-Scraping-project-5.ipynb**
  - This Jupyter notebook contains the code for web scraping data from various sources. It includes data extraction, cleaning, and preliminary analysis.

- **Project_5_modeling.ipynb**
  - This Jupyter notebook is focused on data modeling. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms to the scraped data.

- **main.py**
  - The main Python script for running the project. It orchestrates the workflow, including data scraping, modeling, and saving the results.

- **app.py**
  - This Python script contains the code for the web application built with Streamlit. The application visualizes the data and provides an interactive interface for users.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **requests**
- **beautifulsoup4**
- **scikit-learn**
- **streamlit**
- **plotly**

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**

1. **Run Web Scraping**
   - Open `Web-Scraping-project-5.ipynb` and execute the cells to scrape and clean the data.
   
2. **Run Data Modeling**
   - Open `Project_5_modeling.ipynb` and execute the cells to preprocess the data and apply machine learning models.
   
3. **Run the Main Script**
   - Execute `main.py` to run the entire workflow from data scraping to modeling.
   
4. **Run the Web Application**
   - Execute `app.py` to launch the Streamlit web application and visualize the results.

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

**Results**

The web application provides interactive visualizations of the data, including charts and graphs generated from the modeling results. Users can explore the data and gain insights through the user-friendly interface.
